# Hosting WordPress on AWS - Full Guide

This is a (almost) free guide that will teach you how to deploy a fully operational WordPress website on AWS cloud infrastructure. I say almost free because we still have to pay for a domain in Route 53 to make the connection via "traditional" ways through a domain name, secured by an SSL certificate.
